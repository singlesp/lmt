              No matter what faith or path you walk, every person benefits from
              feeling connected to something larger than themselves and to the
              earth. Nature's cycles are a reflection of cycles within
              ourselves, and my methods and practices are rooted in honoring
              that connection.

            <p class="section-lead">
              Your willingness to observe your body is one of the most powerful
              decisions you can make.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our bodies store emotions, memories, beliefs, and experiences,
              sometimes manifesting as pain, tension, or discomfort. Through
              healing touch I help you become more aware of what your body is
              telling you so you can release what no longer serves you.
            </p>
            <p>
              I use Thai massage, neuromuscular deep tissue, craniosacral
              therapy, energy work, and breath to help your body return to
              balance.

            <h2>Mindfulness Based</h2>
            <p class="section-lead">Awareness is the first step towards change.</p>
            <p>
              Guided meditation, breath awareness, and body awareness all go
              hand in hand. Just 15 minutes of meditation a day has been shown
              to shift brain and body chemistry. Simple belly breathing can help
              switch the nervous system from fight-or-flight into rest and
              repair mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              During sessions I may ask you to bring attention to your breath
              and sensations in the body. The breath is the bridge between the
              conscious and the unconscious, helping your body feel safe enough
              to let go and heal.

              I love what I do and feel incredibly grateful to have landed in a
              profession that fulfills and supports me as much as it does my
              clients. I come from two generations of healers, bodyworkers, and
              psychotherapists. When I finally embraced the call, my path began
              to blossom.
            </p>
            <p>
              I see mind, body, and spirit as connected. My gift is to work
              primarily through the physical as a doorway to healing on all
              levels. The body does not lie — it holds patterns, stories, and
              truths that can be supported with attentive touch and presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Massage and bodywork are often the gateway, and the journey can go
              as deep as you want it to go.

              “As a nationally certified massage therapist and professional body
              and energy worker for over 20 years, I’ve had the great pleasure
              of receiving many types of bodywork. Many are skilled, but what
              makes one great is instinct. Miwa is one of the rare gifted ones
              who has both. Her skills combined with intuition and strength made
              my Thai session the best I’ve ever had.”
